Shut down due to unnatural deaths, this isolated school has been abandoned for decades. Brownstone High School is the first medium-sized map added during early access. Long decrepit hallways, ominous classrooms, grotesque bathrooms, and various vacant office spaces fill the place with a solemn atmosphere. Its square shape and general symmetry can make it intuitive to navigate, and depending on the ghost, it may be easier to run during a hunt than to hide.

Often, the faint ringing of a telephone can be heard traveling among the halls. Follow the sound and you just might find the Ghost Room.

Due to the distance between available entrances and the truck, it is recommended to stage gear close to the building before beginning the mission.
