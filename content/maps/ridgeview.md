Ridgeview Road House is one of the Locations in Phasmophobia, being one of the game's three Small maps during Early Access. It is a two-story, four-bedroom house with a garage and basement. It is quite congested with many linear hallways, with most of the rooms either being small, having numerous obstacles, or both. However, the presence of closets and multiple sub-rooms to dive into provides plenty of safety for a Hunt.


As of the current version, a tripod-mounted video camera can be placed on the outside window looking into the Kitchen, allowing for it to be safely monitored even before the door is opened.
