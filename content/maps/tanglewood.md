Tanglewood Street House is one of the locations players can visit and is also the location of the game tutorial. It is a small single-story home with three bedrooms and a bathroom.



Tanglewood can often make for a swift investigation due to its small size, but the open floorplan and only two accessible coat-closets make it very dangerous during a Hunt. This location features a working, interactable television with a remote. It also features several candles that can be lit using a Lighter.
