A Parabolic Microphone can detect sound through walls and at a great distance. It serves as a portable version of the sound sensor. Although infamously finicky, it is very handy to have around in the larger locations such as the High School and Asylum, although largely useless in smaller ones.

When turned on, the display will show a set of numbers (00.0) which measures the sum of sound detected in a large area around its position. The values on the display are updated every 1-2 seconds.

The Parabolic Microphone is required to be pointed in the direction the sounds are being made to pick up any form of interaction on the screen.

If a Ghost interacts with something, such as moving a door, throwing an object, or causing footsteps, the microphone will detect the sound for a short period of time, giving a reading between 1.0 and 3.0 depending on the sound source on the display. If multiple sound sources are in the range of the microphone they will add up and potentially give very high readings.

The microphone has a long range and can detect sound through walls, making it useful for narrowing down the Ghost's location in the larger maps.
