The Crucifix is a purchasable item that is used to prevent the Ghost from entering into a Hunt.

# How it works
For the Crucifix to successfully prevent a hunt, it must be in the vicinity of the ghost when it starts the hunt. The Crucifix's range has a radius of 3 meters for most ghosts, and 5 meters for the Banshee. The Crucifix works both when placed down or while being held. When the ghost initiates the hunt, it checks to see if it is in range of a crucifix. If it is, the hunt does not begin, and all the lights will be turned off while taking one of two charges the Crucifix has.

If the ghost is out of range of the Crucifix (even if the Crucifix is located in the Ghost Room), it may initiate a hunt as per normal. No sound or animation will occur when the crucifix blocks a hunt, other than all the lights turning off. It will simply disappear once both charges have been used.

The Crucifix must be within range of the ghost's hunting spawn location in order to work. Because of this, the Crucifix isn't always reliable, since the ghost may spawn at a random distance away from its "center point" (ghost room), or it may just be roaming far from its room.

If a crucifix stops a hunt, the Total Activity chart will show 10 very briefly and then drop sharply.

Although the Crucifix works while in hand, it is still the best choice to place it down just to be safe.
