The EMF Reader is a purchasable piece of Equipment used to read the strength of Electro-Magnetic Fields in the nearby environment.

The EMF Reader is required to detect Evidence of EMF Level 5.

How It Works
The EMF Reader is a small white box adorned with five coloured LED-lights, indicating the different EMF levels:

Whenever a Ghost interacts with the environment and depending on the type of interaction, the EMF Reader will light up various numbers of its LEDs. If the Ghost causes multiple interactions within a short time frame, the one with the highest EMF Level will be indicated by the EMF Reader.

The EMF reader can be dropped on the floor, which increases its detection range. It should be noted, however, that it is a directional tool and will detect activities in the direction it is facing.

As with other interact-able hand-held items, players can switch another player's equipped Thermometer on or off.

EMF Levels
Main article: EMF
EMF Level	LED Colour	Ghost Activity
1	Green	None, default state
2	Green	Interacting with an object
3	Yellow	Throwing an object
4	Orange	Manifestation
5	Red	Evidence (25 % chance)
Each EMF Level can be photographed separately in order to receive extra money at the end of a mission.

EMF Level 5
Main article: EMF Level 5
EMF Level 5 is special in that it does not necessarily indicate strong activity or immediate danger to the player. If the Ghost has it as a possible piece of Evidence, each EMF occurrence of Levels 2, 3 or 4 has a 25 % chance to trigger a Level 5 indication instead.

EMF Level 5 can prove to be quite location-sensitive, often requiring the player to aim the reader at a specific location within the Ghost Room during elevated activity, often the place the Ghost has been standing in, which may be deduced with the help of ultra-violet Footprints, caused by the Ghost walking through Salt.

Trivia
Use of Motion Sensors and consulting the Site Activity Monitor can be used to be pinpoint locations where the ghost has been, and at what times it may give an active reading.
While unable to see the EMF Reader during a Hunt, the Ghost can still hear its beeping noise and the close-range noise of turning it on and off, betraying the player's location.
Placing the EMF Reader in front of a camera allows the player to observe its level indications from the safety of the truck. However, taking a picture of EMF Level 5 via the monitor will not count as evidence.
