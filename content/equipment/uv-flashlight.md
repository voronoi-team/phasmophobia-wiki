The UV Flashlight is a purchasable starter item used to detect Fingerprints and Footprints. It can be carried and activated at the same time as a standard Flashlight or Strong Flashlight, but the faint fingerprints might not be visible under their light.

# Tips
- A UV Flashlight is not required to take a photo of fingerprints, only for players to see them; they may be discovered by errant photographs without having a UV Flashlight at all.
- UV Lights can be turned on and thrown around the house to light up the space, since the ghost can't turn them off.
- As with the regular Flashlight, it will flicker during a Hunt.
