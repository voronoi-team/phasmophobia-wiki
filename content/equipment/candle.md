Candles are deployable light sources that can be lit using a source of fire such as the lighter, which can be used to light up a room and prevent the player's sanity from dropping. Players can purchase candles, but they can also spawn on maps. Similar to the glow stick, the candle can be placed on the ground and will continuously emit light.

Lit candles and turned on lights will help slow, but not stop your sanity from dropping, so they should not be completely relied on.

Ghosts tend to blow out nearby Candles, making them effective at checking if a ghost is nearby.

# How to Use
When holding a candle, players can light it by having the lighter in their inventory and pressing the F key.

Players can light candles that are not in their hand by holding the lighter or a lit candle in one hand and pressing the F key while near the unlit candle.

# Tips

- Dropping candles where they sit on the sides of tables, shelves, or other elevated objects will significantly improve their lighting, since candles produce weak visibility on the ground (mainly when dropped on carpets, as carpets are slightly above ground level, but function as light solid objects - lights cannot pass through light solid objects).
- In larger maps like Brownstone High School or the Asylum, candles may be helpful as navigation markers for important areas such as the fuse box, ghost room, or exit door(s).
- Candles are not affected by Hunts.
- Candles found on-site can also be lit up with a lighter or another lit candle.
- The candles available for purchase are significantly brighter than the ones found on-site.
