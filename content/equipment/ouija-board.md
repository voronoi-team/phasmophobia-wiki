The Ouija Board is a special item in Phasmophobia. It has a 50% chance to spawn during an investigation on each map, and can be used to communicate with the Ghost at the cost of Sanity. The Ouija Board is usually hidden out of sight and can be found in places like basements, attics, beds, closets, and storage rooms.

How It Works
The Ouija Board can be activated and deactivated by left clicking on it. An active board is lit up while an inactive board isn't.

Once activated, the characters on the board will start to glow. Despite push-to-talk being enabled, The Ouija Board will always recognize response without Local chat or Global chat. If not, press the V key to ask questions via Local chat. When active and asked a phrase it recognizes then the board will always either give a response or else turn off. If the Ghost does not respond then try asking it a question using Global chat (i.e. the radio) instead of local chat. If it is asked a question but nothing happens then either the board is not on or else the phrase was not heard or not recognized.

When active and asked a phrase that it recognizes, there is a 67% chance for the Ouija Board to respond (success) and a 33% chance to anger the ghost (failure). If successful then the ghost will respond by moving the planchette on the board to spell out its answer. Failure is indicated by the board and the lights in the Map flashing on an off a few times, before the board eventually turns off, in which case a much larger amount of sanity will be lost. The response chance (i.e. success or failure) is not affected by whether or not the ghost is shy.

Photo
You can use the Photo Camera to take a photo of the Ouija Board (while it is on or off), rewarding 5$ with a photo labelled as ''Ouija Board''. When the ghost answers, you can take a photo of that which will count as an "Interaction", giving another 5$.

Most times, taking a picture of the board on the floor will not register a ''Ouija Board'' or ''Interaction'' photo. To avoid this bug where these two photographs might not register in the Journal, it is advised to not have the Ouija board lying flat on the ground; instead, place it on an elevated surface like a table, bed, or counter. Alternatively, looking straight up and then dropping the board (by pressing "G") will usually result in the board standing upright/vertically on the ground (if the ground is flat); this orientation will also avoid this bug.

Risks
Sanity Decay
When the ghost responds to a question, it will create an interaction EMF around the Ouija Board, and the player who asked the question will experience a 5-10% sanity decay unless the ghost is a Demon.

Ghost Angered
If the Ouija Board fails, the board will deactivate, the lights will flicker, and the user's sanity will drop by 40%, even if the ghost is a Demon. If the players are still in the Setup Phase, it will end prematurely, rendering them vulnerable to a Hunt.

Starting a Hunt
The Ghost will hunt more frequently as the average Sanity of all (living) players decreases. To quickly decrease the average sanity, players may take advantage of the Ouija Board's sanity drain by simply using the Ouija Board repeatedly until the average Sanity has decreased enough, which will cause the Ghost to start Hunting more frequently. This is useful when the last objective is the Crucifix Optional Objective (i.e. to stop a Hunt with a Crucifix) or the Photo of a Ghost objective, but the Ghost is not Hunting or appearing enough.

Questions
There are five different types of questions that can be asked:

Victim Questions
Age Questions
Death Questions
Room Questions
Location Questions
Victim
The victim name is a randomly picked first name of either gender that is predetermined at level start.

"Who did you kill?"
"Who is your victim?"
"What is the name of the person you killed?"
"What is the name of the person you murdered?"
"What is your victim?"
"Did you murder?"
"Who did you murder?"
"Who died?"
Age
The age of the ghost is randomly generated number between 2 and 90 years that is predetermined at level start.

"How old are you?"
"What is your age?"
"Are you old?"
"Are you young?"
Death
The length of death of a ghost is a randomly generated number between 50 and 1000 years that is predetermined at level start.

"How long have you been dead?"
"How many years ago did you die?"
"How long have you been here?"
"How long ago did you die?"
"When did you die?"
Room
The response will be determined by the amount of people in the room. If the ghost is in the same room as the Ouija Board, the count is added by one.

"How many are in this room?"
"How many people are in this room?"
"How many people are here?"
"How many ghosts are in this room?"
"How many ghosts are here?"
"Are you alone?"
"Are we alone?"
"Who is here?"
"Who is in this room?"
Location
The location given will be the currently occupied room of the Ghost. The room is likely to be the Ghost Room, but if the ghost is roaming, it will simply be its current location at the time.

"Where are you?"
"What is your favorite room?"
"Where is your room?"
"What is your room?"
"Are you here?"
"Are you close?"
"Are there any spirits?"
"Are you near?"
"Are you around?"
