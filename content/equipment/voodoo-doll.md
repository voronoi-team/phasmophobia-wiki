The Voodoo Doll is an evidence similar to the Bone. Taking a picture of it with the Photo Camera will grant a photo reward at the end of the mission, but it does not reward any extra for picking it up. You can get multiple photo rewards if multiple Voodoo Dolls are found (One photo per Voodoo Doll).

The Voodoo Doll will often slide across the floor in a random direction after being dropped. (It was previously thought to help indicate the direction of the Ghost or the Ghost Room, but there is little evidence supporting this). Taking a picture of the Voodoo Doll after this interaction will count towards Photo Evidence in the Interaction category.

Voodoo dolls can currently only be found on Farmhouses.
