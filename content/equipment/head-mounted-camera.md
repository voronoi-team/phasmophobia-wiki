The Head Mounted Camera can be used to help teams track each other and to see Ghost Orbs.

When worn, Head Mounted Cameras (often called "GhostPros" by players), do not take up a hand slot, and act as a regular video camera. They move with the player and look in the direction the player is facing at the time. Although they are useless when playing alone, they can be handy with a team if one person stays back in the truck.

Like with regular video cameras, HMCs can switch between visual and night-vision modes, and can be used to detect Ghost Orbs when in night-vision mode. They are also handy for monitoring players who have to be alone to get ghost responses, and are very useful for helping to guide players around larger maps, especially in the dark, since the player in the truck can still see with night-vision mode even if all the lights in the location are out, as well as having access to the Site Map.

Players can take them off by going back to the truck and pressing F (or what you have Interact bound to) on the cork-board hangers when they have an empty hand.
