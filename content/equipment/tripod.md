The Tripod can be used to mount Video Cameras on. Tripods will be deployed facing the same direction as the player deploying them.

Tripods are bulky items, and thus take up your hand slot while carrying it. They cannot be stored in your inventory, and switching to another item or hand while carrying a tripod will automatically drop the tripod.

Picking up a video camera and placing it (or pressing F) on top of the tripod will mount the camera on the tripod. Carrying the tripod afterwards will also bring the camera along as well, so you do not need to carry both an empty tripod and an unmounted video camera. You can pick the video camera up off the tripod like normal if you want to use the video camera by itself again.

When placing, the tripod will be placed directly below where you are standing, and will be facing the direction you were when you dropped it. Tripods are set at the perfect height for monitoring items (like books and EMF readers) on the ground and are excellent for rooms with few places for regular video cameras to go. VR players can also place tripod-mounted video cameras on windowsills, allowing a camera to remotely watch a room without requiring the player to enter the room itself to set the camera up.
