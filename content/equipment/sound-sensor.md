The Sound Sensor is a sensor that can listen to the most quiet sounds and vibrations in the air. This is displayed as data at the van.

The Sound Sensor will detect any noise in a boxlike area in front of the sensor itself. The detection area is highlighted as a yellow box on the map back in the truck. Any noise, both player-made and ghost-made, will appear as a bar on the Sound Sensor Screen to the right of the map in the van, showing how loud the sound was and identifying where the sound came from. The screen will display the loudest sound detected, rather than the total volume of all the sounds. The value displayed will update every five seconds.

The area covered by a sound sensor is fixed, but relative to the in-game map and not the building. This means on smaller maps it is good for covering a room or two, but on larger maps such as Asylum, it can cover about a third of one of the wings.

Like the Parabolic Microphone, the Sound Sensor will detect sounds through walls, so placing it on a wall facing a large area or several rooms is a good way to cover a lot of ground when looking for the ghost's location early on. On smaller maps, two Sound Sensors can be placed on either side of a wall in the center of a location, allowing them to monitor an entire floor when placed well.
