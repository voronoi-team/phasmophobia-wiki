The Spirit Box is a piece of Equipment, as well as a type of Evidence, that can be used to ask the Ghost questions to get more information. Only certain Ghosts will respond via the Spirit Box, which can be used as Evidence when identifying the Ghost.

# How to Use
To get a Spirit Box response from the ghost, the following is required:

You must either be in the same room as the Ghost, or else be within 3 meters of it if not in the same room.
The lights in the room must be off; this does not include Flashlights or UV lights/glowsticks, which may remain on. If the player and ghost are in the same room, lights in other rooms (including rooms or hallways that are directly adjacent) may be left on (and any doors between the rooms can stay open).
Shy ghosts will additionally require you to be the only person in the room, but they will sometimes respond when a group is entering a room due to initially only detecting one player.
Of course, a ghost that does not have Spirit Box as evidence will never respond to the Spirit Box. Additionally, a ghost that has Spirit Box as evidence may not respond to it until later in the game (although this is relatively rare).
The Spirit Box will work if thrown on the ground as long as it is left on and you are within range to ask questions and hear the responses. Sometimes, Ghosts respond to Spirit Boxes placed on the ground without players directly trying to get a response with voice commands. While Ghosts can hear when you are talking no matter what, you must be using proximity chat for the Spirit Box to hear you.

It is recommended that the Sprit Box be tested as soon as the Ghost Room has been found because this minimizes the risk that the Ghost will start a hunt while the player is testing the spirit box (which must take place near the ghost, in the dark. and possibly also all alone). Additionally, if the Ghost has Spirit Box as evidence then frequently, this evidence can be obtained almost immediately.

# Types of Questions
You'll know the Spirit Box is working if, after turning it on and talking into it, a prompt reading "Nothing Detected" appears, the Ghost responds to your question, or if the prompt shows what the ghost has said. If neither of these three things happens, it is possible that your microphone is not working or you did not ask one of the supported questions.

If your voice recognition is properly working, it is a requirement to ask a supported question, as the ghost will not respond to just talking normally.

These are some possible answers: Spirit box answers.

# Known Bugs
If you activate the Spirit Box and drop it, and then proceed to pick it up with another item held out. It will mute the static noise and keep the Spirit Box on.
Sometimes a Spirit Box will completely fail, even if you are asking a supported question and have a working microphone. Picking up another Spirit Box can help.
Before the December 11th update of 2020, it was possible for the Spirit Box to receive a response from the ghost no matter how far it was. As long as the player was near the ghost when asked a supported question.
