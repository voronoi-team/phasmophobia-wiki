Ghost Writing Book, also known as automatic writing, is Equipment used to obtain Ghost Writing by placing it near a Ghost.

There is no way to forcefully trigger the book to be written in legitimately.

The book can be written in while in any of the following states, but there are no current mechanics that limit a ghost's ability to write in the book.

- While being held
- While in the darkness or in the light
- While in the view of the player or not
- While upside down or right side up
- While in the player's inventory

Taking a picture with a Photo Camera of the book once written in counts as Photo Evidence in the Interaction category.

If placed within the vision of an active Video Camera, you can use the truck's monitor to see if writing has appeared.
