The Lighter is an item used to light Smudge Sticks and Candles. It emits a small amount of light when activated and held by the player.

# How it works
In order to use the Lighter, you must have the Lighter in your inventory. By using the interact button while holding either a Smudge Sticks or a Candle, it will light the object. Alternatively, you can hold the lighter and activate it with right click, then use it to light dropped items, or even items in another player's hand by interacting with them. If you don't have any candles, you can light the candles that spawn in the environment, and they will act like normal candles.
