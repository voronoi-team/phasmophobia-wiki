The Thermometer is a purchasable piece of Equipment used to read the temperatures in the nearby environment.

The Thermometer can be used to detect Evidence of Freezing Temperatures and is a reliable tool to locate the Ghost Room.

# How It Works
The Thermometer will update its temperature reading every 0.8 seconds, reading by default in degrees Celsius (°C).

The Thermometer reads the temperature by casting a 6-metre ray in the direction the player is facing, making it a directional tool. The recorded temperature fluctuates within a range of ±2 degrees, both for Celsius and Fahrenheit.

# Temperature Thresholds
Temperatures at or below 10°C/50°F (± 2°C/°F) is generally an indication that the player is either in or next to the Ghost Room.

Temperatures at or below 0°C/32°F (± 2°C/°F) will cause the player's breath to become visible, indicating and providing evidence of Freezing Temperatures.

As with other interactable hand-held items, players can switch another player's equipped Thermometer on or off.

# Tip
The Thermometer can read a room's temperature through the door, allowing players to walk up to a door and check for a temperature reading without opening it. This can be especially helpful on larger maps and/or jobs where players have a hard time pinpointing the Ghost Room, wherein leaving doors closed for the Ghost to open can indicate its location.
