The Revenant is one of twelve Ghost types in Phasmophobia. It is infamously known for being a very dangerous Ghost that can catch up to players during a Hunt

Unlike other Ghosts, who will often have a specific target selected when starting a Hunt they will hone in on, Revenants can freely switch targets if there is another player that is closer by - and especially one that is in plain view and available, making its goal of killing players more convenient.

# Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths: A Revenant will travel at a significantly faster speed when hunting a victim. Additionally, the Revenant can freely switch whoever it is targeting during a Hunt.

Weaknesses: Hiding from the Revenant will cause it to move very slowly.

# Evidence

- Fingerprints
- Ghost Writing

# Power
During a Hunt, the Revenant can move twice as fast the default speed when it is chasing a player, but it will move 1.5x slower when it isn&apos;t.

# Strategy
Due to the Revenant&apos;s power, it is critical to hide as soon as possible during a Hunt. A player will not be able to outrun a Revenant for long before it catches up to them. If you are caught running from a Revenant, your last resort is to use Smudge Sticks to disorient it for a few seconds, giving you enough time to break line of sight by turning corners and/or closing doors and hide from it.

A highly dangerous but nonetheless potential method of surviving a chase from a Revenant chase requires at least one other player. A Revenant&apos;s ability to switch targets freely can be used against it. Whoever is not being chased can force a hunting Revenant&apos;s attention on them from a different angle, then another player can do the same thereafter. This leads to the Revenant effectively being &apos;juggled&apos; between multiple players and constantly changing directions without focusing on one player long enough to actually catch and kill them.
