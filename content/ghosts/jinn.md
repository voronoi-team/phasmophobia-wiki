The Jinn is one of twelve types of Ghosts in Phasmophobia.

Jinns tend to interact with electronics more than any other ghost. They may cause phones to ring, radios to activate, TV&apos;s to turn on, or car alarms to go off more often. This also extends to light switches, which may cause unsure investigators to confuse a Jinn for a Mare or Poltergeist; although Mares also have the power to turn lights off, they will not often turn lights back on as Jinn do, and Poltergeists will likely disturb more general objects that aren&apos;t light switches such as doors.


# Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths: A Jinn will travel at a faster speed if its victim is far away.
Weaknesses: Turning off the location&apos;s power source will prevent the Jinn from using its ability.

# Evidence
- EMF Level 5
- Ghost Orb
- Spirit Box

# Power
When the Jinn uses its ability, it will wait for 5 seconds. After this, all players within 3 meters of the ghost will have their Sanity decrease by 25%.

# Strategy
Turning off the location&apos;s breaker will both prevent the Jinn from moving fast during a hunt and make it easier for players to see its ghost orbs. However, this will render the map&apos;s lights inactive (save for Candles), thus leading to the players&apos; Sanity to drain faster. It is up to your team to decide if preventing the Jinn from using its ability is worth dealing with more frequent hunts as a result of lower average sanity.

Jinns can be pretty dangerous to sanity; if the Fuse Box is turned on, it can use its power to decrease the players&apos; sanity in an instant, but if the Fuse Box is off, it will continuously drain sanity since the players will be in darkness.

Most Jinns will leave players well enough alone if they stay out of its Ghost Room, which means if evidence must be gathered, stepping into its area will greatly increase the chances of activity. It also has the risk to decrease your Sanity by a lot, so be careful when you are in the Ghost Room.

Especially-daring players can easily identify the Jinn with its behavior during a Hunt while the power is still on: although it is quick to catch up to players that it is chasing, it will slow down significantly as it nears them, allowing players to re-establish a gap that the Jinn will speed up to close; correctly noting this will allow for the Jinn to be identified without a single piece of evidence needing to be gathered.
