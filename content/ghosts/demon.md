Demons are one of the twelve types of Ghosts in Phasmophobia. They are generally regarded as the most dangerous type of ghost to encounter; noted for being highly aggressive, it will attack more often than any other ghost, and usually without warning. Though it may frequently hinder more conventional methods of investigation, it will also allow ghost hunters to use the Ouija Board without reducing their sanity if a question is answered successfully, allowing for critical information to be obtained with a bit of safety to sanity.

If the investigation and objectives are not dealt with quickly, Demons can grow to be the most challenging ghost. They are notorious for initiating hunts frequently, a trait that is exacerbated by lower sanity levels, and compounded by higher difficulties like Professional where hunts last much longer. Taking all of these factors into account, Demons at their most aggressive will hunt in intervals as short as half-minutes, forcing the players to spend more total time hiding than investigating.

# Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths: Demons are the most aggressive and enter hunt mode more.

Weaknesses: Asking a Demon successful questions on the Ouija Board won&apos;t lower the user&apos;s sanity.

- Ghost Writing
- Spirit Box

# Strategies
It is crucial that players move as quickly and efficiently in gathering evidence as possible, and bring Sanity Pills, Crucifixes, Thermometers and other defensive equipment to keep a Demon from reaching its full aggression. Taking advantage of the Demon&apos;s known weakness with Ouija Boards can get players the information they need to succeed, mainly finding out its Ghost Room without needing to waste time searching.

One should not rely on the Ouija Board for salvation, as it is never a guaranteed spawn on a map; if a Demon is suspected and there is no Ouija Board, one must take every precaution to defend against Hunts, and locate a nearby hiding spot in the event that one occurs. There is also the natural chance that a question asked will fail, resulting in a large amount of lost sanity that further invites a Demon to begin its hunting spree.
