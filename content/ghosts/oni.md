The Oni is one of twelve types of Ghosts in Phasmophobia. It is much more active when players are grouped together.

The Oni is also described as being extremely strong, and it will throw objects around the room with great force when interacting with them. However, these objects are not dangerous to the hunters or their sanity unlike those thrown by Poltergeists.

# Strategies
Since it is one of the most active ghosts in the game, it will more readily give up evidence to a group of investigators, which can make for generous and swift investigations if an Oni is quick to reveal the necessary evidence.

The Oni&apos;s power of being more active when players are around can be misleading on larger maps such as Brownstone High School and Asylum, as it will often wander to players and cause interactions far away from its Ghost Room, creating red herrings. As such, be sure to double check for activity so that an Oni is not leading players away from the location of its ghost room.

Unlike with most other ghost types, splitting up is the best method of defense when searching for an Oni, as it is much less active while players are alone. Though this can be a disadvantageous strategy, particularly if the ghost is revealed to be a Banshee, it can also allow players to find the Ghost Room quicker, as well as keep them from huddling together in hiding spaces during hunts.
