Phantoms are one of the 12 types of Ghosts that can be encountered in Phasmophobia, and the third one described in the Journal. Contrary to popular belief, the Phantom cannot possess ghost-hunters after using a Ouija Board.


# Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths: Looking at a Phantom will considerably drop your Sanity. This refers to any visible manifestations of the Phantom, including during a Hunt.

Weaknesses: Taking a photo of the Phantom will make it temporarily disappear. This, however, will not stop a Hunt.

# Evidence
- EMF Level 5
- Freezing Temperatures
- Ghost Orb

# Power
When a Phantom uses its power, it will navigate to a random player&apos;s location, creating an Interaction EMF at its starting location.

Looking at a Phantom will reduce your sanity by 0.4 each second, as opposed to 0.2 for other Ghosts.

During a hunt a phantom will flash visible every 1 to 2 seconds as opposed to every 0.3 to 1 second for other Ghosts, making it harder to take a photo of.


When the Phantom manifests, it can take on the appearance of one of your teammates, not excluding the appearance of the viewer, [as can be seen here](https://youtu.be/1o9qKOjKOts?t=1830). The appearance can change with each time the ghost vanishes and returns to view. This can cause a dangerous unnoticed Sanity drop if the viewer does not realize they are not actually looking at a teammate. It is unknown if this is an intentional gameplay mechanic, merely a bug, or if this is even still in the game. As such, more evidence is needed.



# Strategy
Phantoms are easy to identify due to their weakness; if the ghost disappeared after taking a photo of it, it is likely to be a Phantom, although this is not guaranteed, as the ghost may have simply decided to disappear.

Phantoms will drop a player&apos;s Sanity significantly whenever it is seen manifesting or hunting; be mindful if you or one of your teammates are frequently seeing the ghost, as their Sanity will likely be quite low.

As players are rarely, if ever, seen without gear, and Phantoms have been known to simply walk or stand in place, it is quite easy to tell the Phantom from a regular player. If you suspect you might have a Phantom on your hands when playing in a team, intentionally avoid having your hands empty so it is easier to tell a Phantom from a player.

# Lore
A phantom, overall, is simply another term for a ghost. But instead of it being just a ghost, it is way more.

Etymology-wise, Phantom pulls from as early as Greece with the word φᾰντᾰ́ζω, or phantasma, which stands for an apparition or a ghost. it could also be translated to something that isn&apos;t real in general, like a dream or an illusion.[Wikitionary etymology](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/φάντασμα#Ancient_Greek)

As such, phantoms in most tales typically elaborate more on the concept of being an illusion version of something that already exists. You could say that it is a dream ghost.
