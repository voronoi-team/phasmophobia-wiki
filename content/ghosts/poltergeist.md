Poltergeists are one of the 12 types of ghosts that can be encountered in Phasmophobia.

#Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths: A Poltergeist is capable of influencing more objects at once than any other Ghosts, and is capable of shutting multiple doors at once.

Weaknesses: A Poltergeist is almost ineffective in an empty room.

# Evidence
- Ghost Orb
- Fingerprints
- Spirit Box

# Power
When a Poltergeist uses its power, it will throw with all nearby items. If a player is nearby, it will decrease their sanity by 2x the number of items thrown. This will also create an EMF Level 3.

If there are no items near a Poltergeist, it will not use its power.

# Additional Notes
A Poltergeist&apos;s ability to manipulate objects, specifically doors, can make it easier to identify. However, if the ghost is one that specifically affects multiple light fixtures and other electronics at once, it&apos;s more likely to be a Jinn.

Poltergeists throw items with higher force than other ghosts.

Unlike other ghosts, objects thrown by Poltergeists have the ability to decrease player sanity even if they were not looking at the objects being thrown. This can also help to identify the ghost; if a player notices a dip in their sanity after they hear physical disturbances in nearby rooms, they can guess it is likely a Poltergeist they are facing.

An unwritten quirk of the Poltergeist is that they have the greatest capacity to roam from their Ghost Room, going far to move objects away from its space. In larger maps, this can result in red herrings when looking for Ghost Activity and cause players to waste time searching areas that ultimately do not house the Poltergeist.

The poltergeist is the sole ghost that can be identified with only 2 pieces of evidence - Ghost Orbs and Fingerprints.

# Lore
A poltergeist is a type of ghost known for causing physical disturbances, such as loud noises and objects being moved or destroyed. Although claims of supernaturally-caused disturbances date back to the 1st century, references to poltergeists specifically became more common in the early 1600s.

The word poltergeist comes from the German language words poltern (&quot;to make sound&quot; and &quot;to rumble&quot;) and Geist (&quot;ghost&quot; and &quot;spirit&quot;), and the term itself translates as &quot;noisy ghost&quot;, &quot;rumble-ghost&quot; or a &quot;loud spirit&quot;. A synonym coined by Ren√© Sudre is thorybism, from Greek thorybein (&quot;to make noise or uproar; throw into confusion&quot;).[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poltergeist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poltergeist)
