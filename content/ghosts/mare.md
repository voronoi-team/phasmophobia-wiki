The Mare is one of twelve types of Ghosts in Phasmophobia. Mares have a higher chance of initiating hunts when players are in darkness, especially if the lights are turned off in the ghost room. It tends to turn lights and the fuse box off more than any other ghost type when active, although if a ghost switches lights back on, it is much more likely to be a Poltergeist or Jinn. An active Mare stalking low-sanity players have the capacity to initiate hunts within mere moments of each other, allowing them to rival even Demons in aggression.



# Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths: Increased chance to attack in the dark. As such, it will do what it can to achieve this, such as turning off lights and tripping the fuse box.

# Strategies
As the Mare&apos;s entire strategy revolves around keeping players in the darkness, the simplest solution is to keep the lights on in high-traffic areas such as near the front door and hallways, such as by using Candles if the fuse box is difficult to reach. It is especially important to keep the lights on in the Mare&apos;s ghost room, as this is what actually lowers the Mare&apos;s chance to hunt. A Mare can initiate a hunt when the players&apos; average sanity is lower than 60% when the lights in its Ghost Room is turned off, and at 40% when the lights are turned on.

Be aware of the locations of light switches and the fuse box, as the Mare will often work to turn them off. Keeping a paranormal investigator near them will help counteract the Mare&apos;s habits. Having an investigator &quot;guard&quot; the fuse box is much more useful in larger maps such as Brownstone High School and the Asylum, as the sheer size of those maps makes backtracking to the fuse box much more arduous and potentially dangerous.

Note that staying in the light does not prevent the Mare from hunting; it will still be able to initiate Hunts provided it is not currently the Setup Phase, though it will be less aggressive in doing so when compared to other ghost types.
