A Shade is a type of Ghost in Phasmophobia.

Noted as being shy ghosts, Shades lower their activity in the presence of multiple investigators. Because of its temperament, it can be harder to find Ghost Activity when sticking together. However, like all ghosts in the game, the Shade is more likely to hunt when the players&apos; Sanity is low.

If a Shade is already hunting, it will prefer to target players that are alone. The Shade follows the general definition of &quot;alone&quot;, in the sense of a player being in a room on their own, even if other players are physically close.

# Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths: As a shy ghost, a Shade will rarely perform actions in the presence of two or more people, making it harder to detect.

Weaknesses: Conversely, a Shade will rarely start a Hunt when players are grouped together.

# Strategies
Due to a Shade&apos;s aforementioned shyness, players are left with a hard choice: either stick together to eliminate risks, or go alone to let the Shade do something. Players who are currently alone should exercise caution, especially since the Shade will likely begin Hunting once players are alone.

If there are two or more people in the ghost room, it will not initiate a Hunt. If it is needed to bait out the ghost into hunting mode, make sure there is no more than one player in the ghost room. Some rooms that seem like a single room are actually broken down into multiple rooms. For example, the cell blocks on the Prison Map appear to be broken up into 2 or more rooms. At the very least, the upstairs and downstairs of the cell block are considered individual rooms for this purpose, as a shade will initiate a hunt if only 1 of the players is located at the upstairs cells.

Players should work together as a group to find the Ghost Room first and foremost, especially on Professional difficulty when there is no Setup Phase. Bringing a Crucifix and Smudge Sticks will help prevent attacks if the team splits up to let the Shade perform more activity, especially if one player is attempting to anger it.
