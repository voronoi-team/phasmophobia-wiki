Wraiths are one of the twelve types of Ghosts that can be encountered in Phasmophobia, and the second ghost described in the Journal. Wraiths are best known for being able to &quot;fly&quot;, indicative of them typically not producing footsteps while moving. Additionally, wraiths can see through doors, closets, and lockers while Hunting players—demanding either a more creative hiding spot or a timely escape.

# Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths: Wraiths almost never touch the ground, but this does not apply to the ghost model. Because of this, footprint sounds from a wraith will be rare to non-existent, and they can travel directly through walls doors without having to open them.

Weaknesses: Wraiths have a toxic reaction to Salt. If a Wraith comes into contact with a pile of salt, it will immediately cease attacking.

# Evidence
- Fingerprints
- Freezing Temperatures
- Spirit Box

# Power
When a Wraith uses its power, it will teleport to a spot within 3 meters of a random player, creating an Interaction EMF.

# Additional Notes
Although Salt can make a Wraith stop attacking, it will also permanently increase Ghost Activity.

The Wraith will hover without touching the ground for long periods of time, but it occasionally takes steps on the ground. In other words, a Wraith can still be tracked with salt to some degree. Wraiths can step on and disturb a pile of salt, but they will not leave green footprints. If salt is placed in a doorway, a wraith will most often fly over the salt, leaving a hand print on the door that can be seen with a UV Light. However, this is not guaranteed, and it may result in a glitch where the wraith will enter its hunting phase and never stop.

The Wraith is unfazed by doors and lockers—especially during a Hunt. A Wraith does not see doors or lockers, and can simply phase through them after spotting players trying to hide. Keep this in mind during Hunts, as it can also wander into any room regardless of whether or not the door is closed after manifesting.

# Strategy
Wraiths are proficient at finding players who are hiding in rooms and closets, so placing piles of salt on the way to your exit will force the Wraith to stop attacking and buy time to avoid putting oneself in danger.

Although the Wraith can pass through walls, it cannot see through them; solid walls are still able to break the Wraith&apos;s line of sight.
