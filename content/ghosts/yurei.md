The Yurei is one of twelve types of ghosts in Phasmophobia. Although it does not have any implicit bonuses to its ability to Hunt, its main distinction is its higher drain on the hunters&apos; Sanity during a manifestation; if hunters are careless with their Sanity, it will become aggressive very quickly.

The Yurei is comparable to the Spirit, as both of them have no particular modifiers for their aggressiveness or interactions with the environment, as well as also having special interactions with Smudge Sticks.

# Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths: Yurei have been known to have a stronger effect on people&apos;s Sanity during a manifestation.

Weaknesses: Using Smudge Sticks on the Yurei will cause it to not wander around the location for ~90 seconds.

# Evidence
- Freezing Temperatures
- Ghost Orb
- Ghost Writing

# Power
A Yurei will drain sanity at 0.4% per second during a manifestation, this is higher then the usual 0.2% per second from other ghosts.

The higher manifestation drain will also happen during a hunt if the player is within 10 meters of the ghost.

There is speculation if ghost events have a 2x sanity drain then normal, this is unconfirmed.

There is a common misconception that the Yurei has a higher passive sanity drain for being in the dark, this has been debunked.

# Strategies
Be sure to get away from the Yurei when it does manifest if you aren&apos;t taking a photo of it.

Be sure to keep track of Sanity, and use Sanity Pills when necessary, as players will ultimately reach lower sanity levels faster, allowing for the Yurei to become more aggressive and be able trigger Hunts sooner into a mission.
