Spirits are one of the 12 types of Ghosts that can be encountered in Phasmophobia, and the first one described in the Journal.
    
With no special powers, and a harsher reaction to Smudge Sticks, Spirits serve as a baseline to measure other Ghosts against. With their behavior ranging from shy to active, passive to hostile, a Spirit can have any number of perceived characteristics. It is this lack of defining traits that can confuse investigators; therefore, until clear evidence is established, a Spirit can be easily mistaken for another entity.

Currently, there is a bug when investigating the School or Asylum, wherein a Spirit may be able to move at incredible speed. It is unknown when this issue will be patched.

# Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths: The spirit has no discernible strengths, however it is known to increase its hunting as your sanity drops.

Weaknesses: Using Smudge Sticks on a Spirit will stop it attacking for 180 seconds instead of 90.

# Evidence
- Ghost Writing
- Fingerprints
- Spirit Box

# Trivia
Although the Journal says that the Spirit is the most common ghost, all ghost types actually have the same chance of getting selected by the game.
