The Banshee is one of twelve types of Ghosts in Phasmophobia.

Unlike other ghosts, who will often change their selected target between Hunts, Banshees will always target the same player every time it hunts until it successfully kills them. While this means other players are safe from the Banshee&apos;s power so long as its target is alive, it makes carrying out objectives by the targeted player more difficult, though at the same time making it much easier for other players.

# Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths: A Banshee will focus on one player at a time until it kills them or the player leaves the building.
Weaknesses: Banshees fear the Crucifix, which boosts the Hunt-stopping range of one from 3 meters to 5 meters against it.

# Power
Once a Banshee uses its power, it will begin to navigate to its chosen target. Line-of-sight blockers and hiding have no effect on the Banshee&apos;s ability to navigate to the player, and it will be able to reach them. It will not actually follow the player, but it will mark the target&apos;s location when it used its power. After reaching the location, it will wait ~20 seconds, then proceed to begin a Hunt if the player has been within direct line-of-sight of the Banshee during this waiting time.

The Banshee will never switch targets unless the target dies or leaves the game. The Banshee will cancel its ability if no players are in the building, disabling its ability to hunt.

The Banshee is capable of hunting players that are very far away from the ghost room who think they are safe, even on the largest of maps. A Banshee that uses its power to hunt before the ghost room is located can also trick players into thinking the ghost room is close, as they hear the ghost nearby, when in reality the Banshee has just walked from a different location of the map to the player.

The Banshee&apos;s power ignores sanity and typical hunting rules, meaning it can potentially begin a hunt with its power within moments of the hunters entering the location on Professional or Intermediate difficulties. A hunt beginning very early on while all players have high sanity could be a sign of a Banshee using its power. The Banshee will also ignore players that are not its target during a hunt, allowing for easy photos and little need to hide while the target is known.

# Strategies
Due to the Banshee&apos;s focus on a single player character, determining who the targeted player is early on can trivialize contracts involving them by having the target hide far away from the Banshee, preferably near a good hiding spot, to lower its chances of ever actually killing its target. However, this requires all players to survive the Hunt lest the Banshee acquire a new target, starting the process all over again.

# Trivia
The Banshee is a female spirit in Irish folklore who heralds the death of a family member, usually by wailing or shrieking. A Banshee translates to &quot;woman of the fairy mound&quot; or &quot;fairy woman&quot; in its roots from Ireland.
